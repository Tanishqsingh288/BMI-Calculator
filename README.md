# BMI-Calculator
It is a simple project made by using only HTML CSS and Java Script which calculates your Body Mass Index based on your given inputs. You can also use this as your Semester project or College project. It is coded very efficiently with added responsiveness. It took me no longer than 6hrs to built it. And yes I have used no AI to built this Thankyou
