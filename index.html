                            Body Mass Index (BMI) is a numerical value derived
                            from an individual's weight and height, used to
                            assess whether a person is underweight, normal
                            weight, overweight, or obese. It is calculated by
                            dividing a person's weight in kilograms by the
                            square of their height in meters (kg/m²).

                            BMI provides a simple, general measure of body
                            fatness for most people and helps identify potential
                            health risks related to weight. <b>The World Health
                            Organization (WHO) categorizes BMI ranges as
                            follows: underweight (BMI < 18.5), normal weight
                            (BMI 18.5-24.9), overweight (BMI 25-29.9), and
                            obesity (BMI ≥ 30).</b>

                            However, BMI has limitations.BMI, while a useful
                            general tool, has significant limitations. For
                            instance, it cannot distinguish between lean body
                            mass (muscle and bone) and fat mass. Consequently,
                            very muscular individuals might be categorized as
                            overweight or obese, even if they have low body fat.
                            Conversely, someone with low muscle mass might fall
                            into the normal weight range despite having excess
                            body fat.BMI does not account for fat distribution,
                            which is crucial since abdominal fat poses a higher
                            health risk than fat stored in other areas.
